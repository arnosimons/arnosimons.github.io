How are the policies made that affect us all? 

Part of the answer to this question lies in transnational dynamics. Since the late 2000s I have investigated how major environmental and social policies around the world were drafted from generic blueprints like "cap-and-trade" and "evidence-based-policy". In particular, I have focused on two related phenomena: instrument constituencies and policy experimentation.

## Instrument constituencies

**Policy instrument constituencies** are networks of actors and practices oriented towards developing and promoting particular policy-designs as "solutions" to policy "problems". A constituency and its instrument are co-evolving: each is shaping and shaped by the other. The more a consituency builds and reflects a collective strategy, and the more such a collective strategy is perceived by others, the more we can speak of the constituency as a collective policy actor.

Importantly, instrument constituencies tend to frame their instruments in two distinct ways. On the one hand, they speak of generic **blueprints**, e.g. "the principle of cap-and-trade", to claim  universality for their solutions. On the other hand, when referring to concrete policies in practice, they speak of instruments as specific **implementations**, e.g. "the European Emissions Trading System".

In the ecosystem of public policy making instrument constituencies thus play a particular role as suppliers of both specific and generic solutions. This separates them from other key policy actors, most importantly epistemic cummunities and advocacy coalitions:

| Name | Source | Composition | Activities
|-------|--------|---------|---------
| Epistemic communities | Haas ([1992](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001442)) | Scientists and issue experts, NGO activists, public agencies | Developing conceptions of problems/ goals 
| Instrument constituencies | Voß and Simons ([2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.923625)) | Scientists and design experts, consultants, administrators and technicians | Developing suites of tools and techniques
| Advocacy coalitions | Sabatier ([1988](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00136406)) | Politicians, parties and legislators, interest groups | Developing identities, interests and ideologies 

Table based on Béland and Howlett ([2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12179)).

Instrument constituencies were first conceptualized and empirically described in [a](https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.923625) [series](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892914000381) [of](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315886985-11/politics-means-making-emissions-trading-instrument-pre-history-carbon-trading-arno-simons-jan-peter-vo%C3%9F) [papers](https://doi.org/10.1080/14494035.2017.1375248) that I co-authored with Jan-Peter Voß and with Carsten Mann. Recently, Alexander Schniedermann and I have further developed this concept to include constituencies of what we call [meta policy instruments](/meta-policy-instruments-and-their-constituencies).

## Policy experimentation

Another key observation in my studies has been that the development of public policies is often framed as an **experimental process**. It is suggested that governments can "learn" from "sucessful" or "failed" attempts to implement policies in specific settings, carried out either by themselves or by others. But things are not so simple. 

More often than not, policy experiments are much less rational than promoted. In fact, their very framing as a rationalist undertaking often serves to **depoliticize** the politics actually involved in these experiments. My co-authors and I have argued that policy experiments *create* rather than discover political options, that they *shape* rather than necessitate decisions, and that they *reproduce* rather than avoid ideologies. 

A better way of thinking about policy experimentation is to view it [as a process of "co-production"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-018-9313-9), in which knowledge, values and social order are mutually constituted. In this light, even the above-mentioned distinction between bluenprints and implementations appears as a co-product, [a useful fiction of scalability](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.893120),
 capable of mobilizing actors and resources toward the implementation of similar policies around the globe, even when the "evidence" speaks against the success of these policies.

 Instead of naively hoping for rational "lesson drawing", we should engage with policy experiments (and other forms of ["evidence-based policy"](https://doi.org/10.1332/030557321X16225469993170)) as what they are: political processes in their own right. [Critical reflection](https://policyandpoliticsblog.com/2021/07/07/why-evidence-based-policy-is-political/) is important, also of [the ethics behind policy experimentation](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17308-5_5), but so is the [active engagement with the constituencies and stakeholders](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/4776/1/challenging_futures_biodiversity_offsets.pdf) that shape policy experiments.
