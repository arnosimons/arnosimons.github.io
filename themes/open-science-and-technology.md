That science and technology should become more ‘open’ seems commonplace by now. But what exactly does this mean? Open what, why and for whom? Interestingly, ‘openness’ in science and technology is advocated by very different camps, certainly including neo-liberals as well as market skeptics. As a result, some of the articulated motivations for opening up science and technology seem to stand in direct opposition from one another. Whereas some hope that openness helps to strengthen and improve capitalism, others contend that it could be a path to alternative socio-political relations. This picture only inverses when we look at the critique of opening up science and technology. Here, too, we find critics of various camps. Whereas pro-market people fear that openness could threaten the business world, anti-market people warn that openness could be a Trojan Horse that undermines important democratic values.
