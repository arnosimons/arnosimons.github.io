It is a widespread belief that science and technology should ‘open up’. But what exactly does this mean? Open what, why, and for whom? Interestingly, ‘openness’ in science and technology is advocated by very different camps, certainly including neo-liberals as well as market skeptics. As a result, some of the articulated motivations for opening up science and technology seem to oppose each other almost orthoganally. Whereas some believe that openness helps to strengthen and improve capitalism, others hope that openess creates a path to an alternative political economy. The picture only inverses when we look at the critique of opening up science and technology. Here, too, we find critics of various camps. Whereas pro-market people fear that openness could threaten the business world, anti-market people warn that openness could be a Trojan Horse that undermines important democratic values.
