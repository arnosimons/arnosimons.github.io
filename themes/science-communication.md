Science communication is the practice of informing, educating and raising awareness of science-related topics. Two types of science communication are commonly distinguished: **internal science communication**, which includes scientific conferences and publishing, and **external science communication**, including science journalism, popular science books and science museums. But the boundary between these two types is not always clear cut, neither is the boundary between the scientific "expert" and the non-scientific "layperson". In fact, often the very "boundary work" required to uphold this distinction in practice is more interesting than the distinction itself.

My own research in this area is related to four main topics: 1) scientific policy advice, 2) systematic reviews, 3) preprints and the media, 4) Wikipedia, and 5) biomedical translation.

## The "cap and trade" literature

Studying such boundary work was one focus of [my doctoral dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5561) about the making of "cap-and-trade". Generally I traced how the claim that cap-and-trade works both "in theory" and "in practice" was established and made authoritative in a network of cross-referencing texts from different domains over a period of mseveral decades. Part of this effort was to establish authoritative speaker positions for environemntal economists as a professional group, to specific economists as key experts on cap-and-trade, and to "the cap-and-trade literature" as an authoritative stock of knowledge, to be cited by policy papers and legal documents.

## Systematic reviews

More recently, our group at the German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW) investigated the role of **systematic reviews** as a vehicle for internal and external science communication.

In biomedicine, and increasingly in other fields as well, systematic reviews are seen as the key tool for producing state-of-the-art synthesis of current evidence on a given research question. The goal of a systematic review is to reduce possible biases by identifying, appraising and synthesizing *all* relevant studies on a particular topic. The design, conduct and reporting of systematic reviews have been subject to intense debates and given rise to the fomulation of protocols and guidelines. 

In one study, we analyzed how systematic review attained their high status in discourses of "evidence-based-medicine" [through the crafting of PRISMA reporting guidelines](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003188612-8/top-hierarchy-guidelines-shape-systematic-reviewing-biomedicine-alexander-schniedermann-clemens-bl%C3%BCmel-arno-simons). We found that PRISMA guideline documents employ a procedural understanding of evidence practices and in crucial ways resemble clinical treatment guidelines. This makes them authoritative and affords regulation.

## Preprints and the media

The media are a key channel for external science communication. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the relationship between science and the media has been put to a new test. On the one hand, the pandemic
has led to the strengthening and increased visibility of both anti-science and anti-media
populism. On the other hand, Covid-19 has spurred an unprecedented growth and acceleration of scientific research and publishing in the biomedical field and beyond.

Strikingly, the pandemic has also affected the way in which scientific findings are communicated both internally and externally, espically through the explosion of preprints. Preprints are scientific papers uploaded on the internet before they have passed peer review, the typical academic quality control meachanism. During the pandemic, preprints have increasingly been used to accelerate science communication and to inform pandemic policymaking timely.

To the media, preprints are a double-edged sword. While the preliminary status of their findings makes preprints a less reliable source, their timeliness affords the competition for timeliness in journalism. We scanned nearly
half a million German press articles issued between 2018 and 2021 inclusive and identified 1006 articles that mentioned preprints. We found that journalists used and discussed preprints both positively and negatively. But we also sensed a dilemma. While journalists are not generally in the position to assess the quality of unreviewed publications they are competing for the latest news and sources. They may thus be tempted to cite preprints even when their results are of poor quality, which can be risky given the media's central role for external science communication.

## Wikipedia

The world's leading online encyclopedia, Wikipedia is a new and important channel for science communication. The platform covers a wide range of science-related topics and due to its policy of using reliable sources, many Wikipedia articles cite academic papers and books.

To study how science is reported on Wikipedia, we conducted two in-depth case studies on Wikipedia's representation of the Nobel Prize winning CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In a first paper, we explored to what extent the selection of academic literature cited by Wikipedia's central CRISPR articles adheres to scientific standards and inner-scientific perspectives by assessing its [overlap with the Web of Science database and other citation corpora](). We found that Wikipedia references a substantial amount of those publications that are well acknowledged by experts and highly cited, but that it also cites less visible literature, and, to a certain degree, even not strictly scientific literature.

In a second study, we analyzed how [Wikipedia's historical account of the CRISPR/Cas9 innovation]() has formed over the years and in the interaction of various editors. In particular we focused on controversial moments between editors and their negotiation of "micro notability", i.e. the question which events and people should be mentioned in Wikipeidia's central CRISPR article. An intersting finding was that Wikipedia editors discipline each other about what science reporting on Wikipedia should and should not be. This included not only the question which sources are more or less reliable but also accusations of "self-promotion" against editors who self-identified as CRISPR researchers. 

## Biomedical translation

In the context of debates on biomedical innovation, the translation of biomedical knowledge from "bench to bedside and back" has become a major and widely acknowledged approach. But while the promise of a "translational turn" is raising high expectations and moves money, people and institutions around the world, there is no widely-shared understanding of what exactly this turn should be about.

In a collaborative effort between our group at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Ulrich Dirnagl's group at the Berlin Institute of Health/ Charité Berlin, we have investigated what biomedical translation means to different stakeholder groups, and how such meanings can inform organizational policies. 

In a first paper we identified eight [different collective understandings of biomedical translation](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scaa035) among biomedical researchers, doctors and nurses in Germany. Our findings suggest that while there may not be a one-fits-all solution for improving translation, the notion of biomedical translation works as an umbrella term in stimulating and orchestrating a productive interaction between various viewpoints, practices, and contexts.

In a second paper, we focused on [the role of the clinician scientist](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-019-09367-4), a professional niche proposed as a key solution to closing the "translational gap" between biomedical research and medical practice. In interviews with clinician scientist, clinicians and biomedical researchers, we found that clinician scientists are overburdened with fulfilling a hybrid role of simultaneously being clinicians and scientists. Based on these findings, we suggested a path for the future professional development of clinician scientists towards the role of a translator.

To assist biomedical institutions in fostering translation, we also developed and pusblished [a survey tool for measuring employees’ perceptions of translational research climate](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-020-00234-0) and underlying research practices in organizational environments. Using this tool, we showed that scientists at Charité Berlin perceive translation as a central and important component of their work. Importantly, local resources and direct support are main contributing factors for the practical implementation of translation into their own research practice.
