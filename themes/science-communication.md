Science communication is the practice of informing, educating and raising awareness of science-related topics. Two types of science communication are commonly distinguished: **internal science communication**, which includes scientific conferences and publishing, and **external science communication**, including science journalism, popular science books and science museums. But the boundary between these two types is not always clear cut, neither is the boundary between the scientific "expert" and the non-scientific "layperson". In fact, often the very "boundary work" required to uphold this distinction in practice is more interesting than the distinction itself.

My own research in this area is related to four main topics: 1) scientific policy advice, 2) systematic reviews, 3) preprints and the media, 4) Wikipedia, and 5) biomedical translation.

### Scientific policy advice

Studying such boundary work was one focus of [my doctoral dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5561) about the making of "cap-and-trade". Generally I traced how the claim that cap-and-trade works both "in theory" and "in practice" was established and made authoritative in a network of cross-referencing texts from different domains over a period of mseveral decades. Part of this effort was to establish authoritative speaker positions for environemntal economists as a professional group, to specific economists as key experts on cap-and-trade, and to "the cap-and-trade literature" as an authoritative stock of knowledge, to be cited by policy papers and legal documents.

### Systematic reviews

More recently, Alexander Schniedermann, Clemens Blümel and I have investigated the role of **systematic reviews** as a vehicle for internal and external science communication. For example, we analyzed how systematic review attained their high status in discourses of "evidence-based-policy-and-practice" [through the crafting of PRISMA reporting guidelines](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003188612-8/top-hierarchy-guidelines-shape-systematic-reviewing-biomedicine-alexander-schniedermann-clemens-bl%C3%BCmel-arno-simons).

## Biomedical translation

In the context of debates on biomedical innovation, the translation of biomedical knowledge from "bench to bedside and back" has become a major and widely acknowledged approach. But while the promise of a "translational turn" is raising high expectations and moves money, people and institutions around the world, there is no widely-shared understanding of what exactly this turn should be about.

In a collaborative effort with Ulrich Dirnagl's group at the Charité Berlin, my co-authors and I investigated what biomedical translation means to different stakeholder groups, and how such meanings can inform organizational policies. 

In a first paper we identified eight [different collective understandings of biomedical translation](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scaa035) among biomedical researchers, doctors and nurses in Germany. Our findings suggest that while there may not be a one-fits-all solution for improving translation, the notion of biomedical translation works as an umbrella term in stimulating and orchestrating a productive interaction between various viewpoints, practices, and contexts.

In a second paper, we focused on [the role of the clinician scientist](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-019-09367-4), a professional niche proposed as a key solution to closing the "translational gap" between biomedical research and medical practice. In interviews with clinician scientist, clinicians and biomedical researchers, we found that clinician scientists are overburdened with fulfilling a hybrid role of simultaneously being clinicians and scientists. Based on these findings, we suggested a path for the future professional development of clinician scientists towards the role of a translator.

To assist biomedical institutions in fostering translation, we also developed and pusblished [a survey tool for measuring employees’ perceptions of translational research climate](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-020-00234-0) and underlying research practices in organizational environments. Using this tool, we showed that scientists at Charité Berlin perceive translation as a central and important component of their work. Importantly, local resources and direct support are main contributing factors for the practical implementation of translation into their own research practice.
