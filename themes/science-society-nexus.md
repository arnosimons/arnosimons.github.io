How scientific knowledge does and should relate to public policy making—and to governance more broadly—is certainly not a new question, but one that has gained pressing importance over the past decades, especially in the context of increasingly complex and boundary-spanning challenges like climate change, biodiversity, and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic.

Given the significance of this question, the science-policy nexus (SPN) is surprisingly little understood, especially in overarching conceptual terms. While policy makers and analysts alike have, for several years, been advancing major science-for-policy-related agendas like “evidence-based policy”, “biomedical translation” and “research excellence”, these programmes have been criticised for failing short of their promises and for performing a naive but politically convenient understanding of the SPN. Academically, the relation between science and policy has been explored for decades, but attempts to conceptualize the SPN are scattered across a landscape of only loosely connected subfields, most of which belong either to the political sciences or to the field of science and technology studies (STS).
