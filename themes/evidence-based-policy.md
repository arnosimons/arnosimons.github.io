The idea that public policy making should be informed by scientific knowledge or otherwise modelled after scientific knowledge practices has great appeal. There is a growing understanding among politicians, the media and the public that decision making, especially on complex issues such as climate change and biodiversity, should include a scientific evaluation of the underlying problems, the available solutions, and/or the procedures by which solutions are matched to problems. A phrase often used used in this context is "evidence-based-policy".

In my own research on evidence-based-policy and scientific advice to policy making more generally, I have taken a very ciritcal stance. I love science and I believe that scientific knowledge can be useful for many things including policy making. But I fear that much of the discourse on "evidence-based-policy" is deceiving and conveys false hopes both for science and for policy.

## Instrument constituencies and blueprints

A first major focus of my research in this area has been [the description and study of "instrument constituencies"](https://doi.org/10.1080/14494035.2017.1375248), i.e. expert networks oriented towards developing and promoting particular policy-designs as solutions to policy problems.

The instrument constituency is a previously neglected type of collective actor, whose agency explains the often-observed paradox that in policy making solutions sometimes ["chase"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gove.12179) rather than follow problems. Demand for policy instruments is driven not only by newly arising problems, shifting ideologies or power constellations but also by endogenous dynamics of instrument development, creating a supply push. 

Importantly, instrument constituencies frame their instruments in two distinct ways. Not only are they concerned with the **implementation** of specific policy programs, more importantly, they also tend to develop generic **blueprints**. For example, while [the US Acid Rain Program](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315886985-11/politics-means-making-emissions-trading-instrument-pre-history-carbon-trading-arno-simons-jan-peter-vo%C3%9F) may or may not have been successful or even be remebered, it was legitmated by and has in turn given authority to [the blueprint of "cap-and-trade"](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5561). More generally, policy makers may be compelled or even feel obliged to work with an instrument that is widely regarded as state-of-the-art.

In the ecosystem of public policy making instrument constituencies thus play a unique role. Their focus on specific *and* generic policy solutions and on the knowledge practices around these solutions, [separates instrument constituencies from other key policy actors](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2593626), most importantly epistemic cummunities, which are mostly focussed on problems, and advocacy coalitions, focused on crafting political consensus.

Policy blueprints appear as universal knowledge, produced and circulated by legitimate experts, which makes the toolbox an authoritative knowledge reservoir open to interested policymakers around the world. ‘Authoritative’ in this context means that blueprints in the tool- box enjoy a special status in virtue of which policymakers are likely to accept their prescriptions as compelling, reasonable, and/or legitimate.


Strikingly, the development of "evidence-based-policy" can itself be analyzed as a constituency-driven process, resulting in both a blueprint and various implementated policy programmes.

- standardization/ blueprints



Part of the answer to this question lies in transnational dynamics. Since the late 2000s I have investigated how major environmental and social policies around the world were drafted from generic blueprints like "cap-and-trade" and "evidence-based-policy". In particular, I have focused on three related phenomena: 1) instrument constituencies, 2) policy experimentation and 3) evidence-based policy.

## Instrument constituencies

**Policy instrument constituencies** are networks of actors and practices oriented towards developing and promoting particular policy-designs as "solutions" to policy "problems". A constituency and its instrument are co-evolving: each is shaping and shaped by the other. The more a consituency builds and reflects a collective strategy, and the more such a collective strategy is perceived by others, the more we can speak of the constituency as a collective policy actor.

Importantly, instrument constituencies tend to frame their instruments in two distinct ways. On the one hand, they speak of generic **blueprints**, e.g. "the principle of cap-and-trade", to claim  universality for their solutions. On the other hand, when referring to concrete policies in practice, they speak of instruments as specific **implementations**, e.g. "the European Emissions Trading System".

In the ecosystem of public policy making instrument constituencies thus play a particular role as suppliers of both specific and generic solutions. This separates them from other key policy actors, most importantly epistemic cummunities and advocacy coalitions:

| Name | Source | Composition | Activities
|-------|--------|---------|---------
| Epistemic communities | Haas ([1992](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001442)) | Scientists and issue experts, NGO activists, public agencies | Developing conceptions of problems/ goals 
| Instrument constituencies | Voß and Simons ([2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.923625)) | Scientists and design experts, consultants, administrators and technicians | Developing suites of tools and techniques
| Advocacy coalitions | Sabatier ([1988](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00136406)) | Politicians, parties and legislators, interest groups | Developing identities, interests and ideologies 

Table based on Béland and Howlett ([2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12179)).

Instrument constituencies were first conceptualized and empirically described in [a](https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.923625) [series](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892914000381) [of](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315886985-11/politics-means-making-emissions-trading-instrument-pre-history-carbon-trading-arno-simons-jan-peter-vo%C3%9F) [papers](https://doi.org/10.1080/14494035.2017.1375248) that I co-authored with Jan-Peter Voß and with Carsten Mann. Recently, Alexander Schniedermann and I have further developed this concept to include constituencies of what we call [meta policy instruments](/meta-policy-instruments-and-their-constituencies).

## Policy experimentation

Another key observation in my studies has been that the development of public policies is often framed as an **experimental process**. It is suggested that governments can "learn" from "sucessful" or "failed" attempts to implement policies in specific settings, carried out either by themselves or by others. But things are not so simple. 

More often than not, policy experiments are much less rational than promoted. In fact, their very framing as a rationalist undertaking often serves to **depoliticize** the politics actually involved in these experiments. My co-authors and I have argued that policy experiments *create* rather than discover political options, that they *shape* rather than necessitate decisions, and that they *reproduce* rather than avoid ideologies. 

A better way of thinking about policy experimentation is to view it [as a process of "co-production"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-018-9313-9), in which knowledge, values and social order are mutually constituted. In this light, even the above-mentioned distinction between bluenprints and implementations appears as a co-product, [a useful fiction of scalability](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.893120),
 capable of mobilizing actors and resources toward the implementation of similar policies around the globe, even when the "evidence" speaks against the success of these policies.

 Instead of naively hoping for rational "lesson drawing", we should engage with policy experiments (and other forms of ["evidence-based policy"](https://doi.org/10.1332/030557321X16225469993170)) as what they are: political processes in their own right. [Critical reflection](https://policyandpoliticsblog.com/2021/07/07/why-evidence-based-policy-is-political/) is important, also of [the ethics behind policy experimentation](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17308-5_5), but so is the [active engagement with the constituencies and stakeholders](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/4776/1/challenging_futures_biodiversity_offsets.pdf) that shape policy experiments.
