The idea that public policy making should be informed by scientific knowledge or otherwise modelled after scientific knowledge practices has great appeal. There is a growing understanding among politicians, the media and the public that decision making, especially on complex issues such as climate change and biodiversity, should include a scientific evaluation of the underlying problems, the available solutions, and/or the procedures by which solutions are matched to problems. A phrase often used used in this context is "evidence-based-policy".

In my own research on evidence-based-policy and scientific advice to policy making more generally, I have taken a very ciritcal stance. I love science and I believe that scientific knowledge can be useful for many things including policy making. But I fear that much of the discourse on "evidence-based-policy" is deceiving and [conveys false hopes both for science and for policy](https://policyandpoliticsblog.com/2021/07/07/why-evidence-based-policy-is-political).

## Instrument constituencies and blueprints

A first focus of my research in this area has been [the description and study of "instrument constituencies"](https://doi.org/10.1080/14494035.2017.1375248), i.e. expert networks oriented towards developing and promoting particular policy designs as solutions to policy problems.

The instrument constituency is a previously neglected type of collective actor, whose agency explains the often-observed paradox that in policy making solutions sometimes ["chase"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gove.12179) rather than follow problems. Demand for policy instruments is driven not only by newly arising problems, shifting ideologies or power constellations but also by endogenous dynamics of instrument development, creating [a supply push](https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.923625). 

Importantly, there are two ways in which constituencies make instruments. Not only are they pushing for and helping to manage the **implementation** of specific policy programs, but they are also developing generic policy **blueprints**. For example, while [the US Acid Rain Program](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315886985-11/politics-means-making-emissions-trading-instrument-pre-history-carbon-trading-arno-simons-jan-peter-vo%C3%9F) may or may not have been successful in reducing air pollution cost-effectively, the formulation and implementation of this program had been legitmated by, and has in turn given authority to, [the blueprint of "cap and trade"](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5561). More generally, authoritative blueprints can constitute "policy facts" in ways that policy makers around the world may be compelled or even feel obliged to work with an instrument that is widely regarded as state-of-the-art.

In the ecosystem of public policy making instrument constituencies play a unique role. Their focus on specific *and* generic policy solutions, and on the knowledge practices around these solutions, [separates instrument constituencies from other key policy actors](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2593626), most importantly epistemic cummunities, which are mostly focussed on problems, and advocacy coalitions, which are focused on crafting political consensus. 

## Meta-instruments and their constituencies

Strikingly, the development of "evidence-based policy" can itself be analyzed as a constituency-driven process, resulting in both the implementation of specific policy programmes and, more importantly, a compelling blueprint.

[Evidence-based policy, we argued, can be described as a procedural "meta-instrument"](https://doi.org/10.1332/030557321X16225469993170), a prescriptive model for using certain forms of “evidence” over others, such as quantitative data over qualitative data, positivist frameworks over constructivist frameworks, and instrumentality over critique. A constituency of scientists, policy analysts, consulting agencies, and politicians developed and pushed this model, in part as a means to carve out a professional niche for themselves, for example as evidence providers, evidence educators, or simply "better" politicians.

We concluded that evidence-based policy, as flawed as it may be, can provide important encouragement to integrate some forms of evidence in the policy process. But also that it should be taken for what it is: a political agenda for a specific vision of science in politics, not a self-evident theory of policy making.

## Policy experimentation

A related focus in my studies of evidence-based policy and other forms of scientific policy advise has been that the development of public policies is often framed as an **experimental process**. It is then suggested that governments can "learn" from both "successful" and "failed" attempts to implement policies in specific settings, carried out either by themselves or by others. But again things are not so simple. 

More often than not, policy experiments are much less rational than promoted. In fact, their very framing as a rationalist undertaking often serves to **depoliticize** the politics actually involved in these experiments. My co-authors and I have argued that policy experiments *create* rather than discover political options, that they *shape* rather than necessitate decisions, and that they *reproduce* rather than avoid ideologies. 

A better way of thinking about policy experimentation is to view it [as a process of "co-production"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-018-9313-9), in which knowledge, values and social order are mutually constituted. In this light, even the above-mentioned distinction between bluenprints and implementations appears as a co-product, [a useful fiction of scalability](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.893120),
 capable of mobilizing actors and resources toward the implementation of similar policies around the globe, even when the "evidence" speaks against the success of these policies.

 Instead of naively hoping for rational "lesson drawing", we should engage with policy experiments as what they are: political processes in their own right. [Critical reflection](https://policyandpoliticsblog.com/2021/07/07/why-evidence-based-policy-is-political/) is important, also of [the ethics behind policy experimentation](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17308-5_5), but so is the [active engagement with the constituencies and stakeholders](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/4776/1/challenging_futures_biodiversity_offsets.pdf) that shape policy experiments for better or for worse.
