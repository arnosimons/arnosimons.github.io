A policy instrument constituency is a network of actors and practices oriented towards developing and promoting a particular policy-instrument or instrument mix. A constituency and its instrument are co-evolving: each is shaping and shaped by the other. The more a consituency builds and reflects a collective strategy, and the more such a collective strategy is perceived by others, the more we can speak of the constituency as a collective policy actor.

In the ecosystem of public policy making, instrument constituencies play a particular role. Since they develop and promote policy instruments as solutions to policy problems, they are the key actors in the so-called "policy" stream of the multiple-streams framework (MSF). The role of instrument constituencies is thus different from that of epistemic cummunities and advocacy coalitions, whose agencies have been identified as more relevant to the MSF's "problem" and "solution" streams, respectively.

Instrument constituencies were first conceptualized and empirically described in series of papers I co-authored with Jan-Peter Vo√ü and Carsten Mann. Recently, Alexander Schniedermann and I have further developed this concept to include constituencies of what we call "meta policy instruments".
