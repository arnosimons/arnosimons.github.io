To study the phenomena I'm intersted in I typically follow a discourse analytical methodology. Also, whenever useful, I try to combine qualitative and quantitative tools. On the "qualitative" side, such tools include  conversation and situational analysis, critical discourse analysis, as well as actor-network methodology. On the quantitative side, I'm using bibliometrics, network analysis, and various tools from natural language processing (NLP), including the latest statistical language models. I strongly believe that it is particularly the mixing of such tools that brings both our empirical analysis and our theorizing forward.
