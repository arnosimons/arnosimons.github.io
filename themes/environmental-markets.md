Environmental markets are artificially created "market-like" arrangements meant to serve a political goal, namely the protection of the environment. A key example are "cap-and-trade" systems, which set a limit on overall emissions of hazardous substances, such as Co2, and then allow emitting entities, such as firms, to trade in permits that represent shares of that overall cap. Other examples include fishing quotas, offsets, or compensation banking.
