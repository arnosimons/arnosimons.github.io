# Readme
Hi, I'm Arno Simons and this is my personal Website and Blog.

## Ontology
As a GitHub Page, my website build's on Jekyll's ontology of "collections", "pages" and "posts". Additionally, I differentiate between "themes" and "projects", both of which are represented and interlinked through their own "pages" and further linked to related "posts". All "posts" can be found on my "blog" which is itself a "page".
