In their 1968 book Jazz Dance - The Story of American Vernacular Dance, Marshall and Jean Stearns write:

> "By the mid-sixties a great era seemed to be coming to a close. Jazz dance is a thrilling art that deserves study. We enjoy it very much and regret its passing - it is perhaps too much to hope for a revival."

How right and wrong they were at the same time! Right, because Jazz Dance indeed is a thrilling art that deserves study. Wrong, because the revolution did happen (in the 1980s) and it has given birth to a new era of jazz and swing dance unprecedented in scope. I am happy and proud to be part of today's Berlin and international swing dance community, and I am only beginning to document my journey through this fantastic world with my camera.
