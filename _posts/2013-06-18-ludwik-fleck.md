I first encountered the writings of the Polish medical microbiologist Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961) during my graduate studies at Bielefeld University. After reading both Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Fleck’s Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache (Genesis and development of a scientific fact), I compared the two books in a course paper. My conclusion was that Fleck not only preluded most of Kuhn’s central themes but that he was, in a sense, even the “better Kuhn.” Only much later I understood that Fleck’s writings contain, in fact, a whole sociology of knowledge.

A few days ago I started browsing a recent collection of material by Fleck, containing essays, letters, and protocols. Apart from Fleck’s heartbreaking testimonies of his stays at Auschwitz and Buchenwald, I found the 1935 letter exchange between Fleck and Moritz Schlick, then the head of the famous Vienna Circle, particularly interesting. Fleck, intending to redefine epistemology (as a social practice) but cut off from the leading epistemologists of his time (consider that Fleck was a medical microbiologist, not a philosopher), approaches Schlick for comments on Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache (then still a manuscript with a slightly different title), probably also hoping for publication support. Schlick’s answer, however, doesn’t exactly suggest great admiration for Fleck’s ideas. In a way Schlick’s answer thereby ironically exemplifies one of Fleck’s central notions: “Denkstil” (thought style). It must have been rather difficult for Schlick to fully appreciate and make sense of Fleck’s ideas, simply because they originated from a Denkstil so bizarrely different from that cultivated in the Vienna Circle.
