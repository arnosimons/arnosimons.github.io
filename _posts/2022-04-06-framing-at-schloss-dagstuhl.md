Introduced in 1960’s sociology, framing has been imported into communication sciences and media studies as an attempt to address the ways in which news is reported and, thus, a way in which to tackle manipulation and fake news. The topic has spread to other disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, semantics, pragmatics, political science, journalism, and, most recently-–to computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. 

In March 2022 I attended the [Dagstuhl Seminar "Framing in Communication: From Theories to Computation"](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=22131), which aimed to pave the way to synthesising definitions developed in these theoretically and empirically driven areas and then to operationalise them in computational and applied areas by means of cross-disciplinary hands-on exchanges in facilitated discussions. Framing, being less transparent at the linguistic surface, has seen only very few attempts on formal modelling so far. However, a computational treatment of framing could be a central next step-–extending opinion and argument analysis-–and its operationalisation calls for a deeper understanding of the term and the underlying mechanisms.

In this fantastic intellectual environment among inspiring people I gave a short introductory talk on the history of the framing concept in sociology and its roots in Gestalt Psychology, Phenomenology, and Pragmatism. I argued that the computational operationalisation of framing can be benefitial not only to sociological analysis but also theory development but that we must critically reflect our own performativity. 

These were my slides:
