According to Wikipedia, "a [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher) is someone who practices philosophy" while "[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) \[...\] is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language". Therefore, 

> "A philosopher may also be someone who has worked in the humanities or other sciences which over the centuries have split from philosophy, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics."
