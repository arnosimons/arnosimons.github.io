In most musical instruments the number of sounds you'll hear directly correlates with the number of certain sequential playing movements. In other words, the number of sounds generally result from trivial addition of what you see. For example, to produce two sounds, a pianist could press two keys one after the other or, alternatively, the same key twice in a row. But she could not make two sounds by a sequence of five presses:  key 1, key 2, key 1, key 2, key 1. 

Sourcing movements = movements necessary for producing a sound potential. Examples: a) compressing or expanding bellows in the accordion, b) moving the record in turntablism, c) pulling back a lifted bow to be able to start a new stroke (e.g. when playing two up-bows in a row)
Duration movements = movements necessary for shaping the duration of a sound
Starting movements = movements that initiate a sound, e.g. a) plucking, b) landing an up or down bow, c) pressing a key, d) hitting a drum
Stopping movements = movements that stop a sound, e.g. a) organ stops, b) holding down strings/hi-hats to mute them, c) lifting an up or down bow

Modulation movements = necessary for shaping the pitch, the intensity (loudness) or the timbre (quality) of a sound, e.g. a) bending, b) sliding, c) vibrato, d) speeding up/down


Relevant/ irrelevant movements for altering the number of sounds
Accordion: 1) fingers pressing + 2) compressing air with the arms
Piano: 1) fingers pressing ...+ 2) pedals
Violin: 1) bowing up/down, 2) lifting/landing
Guitar: 1) plucking right, 2) hammer-on/ pull-off left, ....+ 3) holding down left

Turntablism: 1) record movement, 2) fader cut-in/cut-out WHEN during record movement + 3) fader slide, 4) fader cut-in/cut-out at end/beginning of record movement)
