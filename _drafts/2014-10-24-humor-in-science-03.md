My friend Engin pointed me to this very instructive paper by A Few [Goodmen 2014](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/joshuagoodman/files/goodmans.pdf) about the phenomenon of surname-sharing in co-authored publications. Absolutely frontier-pushing, as these few Goodmen explain:

Our contribution to this literature is twofold. First, we believe this paper is the first written by four economists who share a surname...Our second, and related, contribution is that the four coauthors of this paper are unrelated by marriage, blood or current campus.
