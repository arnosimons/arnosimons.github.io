## Introduction to the Series

The stereotypical scientist is highly intelligent but socially awkward, only occasionally evil but always on the brink of insanity.

Humor is less often attributed to scientists. Humor seems to have no place in science, other than as an object of research. Scientific theories of humor attempt to explain what humor is, what social functions it serves, and when something is considered funny. Needless to say that there is The International Society for Humor Studies, which issues the quarterly journal Humor: International Journal of Humor Research.

But luckily (and funnily) the science of humor is not the only way in which humor is in science. Apart from funny remarks within scientific publications, of which there are plenty (certainly more than anyone expects), there are rare gems of published papers that work as jokes in themselves. And why not? If scientists are apes, and if apes have humor (Gamble 2001), it follows that scientist should have humor, too. Being a (social) scientific ape myself, I can confirm that this is true. In this new series I will showcase my favorite examples of publications-as-jokes to prove that scientists are a funny tribe.

## Writer’s Block

Episode 1 introduces a hilarious line of research into a painstaking psychological condition all scientist will sooner or later find themselves in. In 1974 Dennis Upper published a path-breaking article in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis on “The Unsuccessful Self-Treatment of a Case of ‘Writer’s Block”:

As the author notes,

Given the severeness of Upper’s findings, they have inspired some important follow-up research. In 1983, Geoffrey Molloy successfully (or unsuccessfully?) replicated Upper’s original study in Perceptual and Motor Skills. Two years later, Skinner et al., also in Perceptual and Motor Skills, suggested a group modification of these self-treatment procedures. In a 1996 follow-up study in the same journal, Skinner and Perlini reported that

> [w]eekly one-hour administration of these group protocols has continued to be ineffective over a 10-yr. follow-up period.

Since then,

> [a] wide literature of the unsuccessful treatment of writer’s block has emerged,

as McLean and Thomas explain in their meta-analysis in Psychological Reports. Their conclusion:

> Results of the reported findings suggest that group-treatments tend to be slightly more unsuccessful than self-treatments.

Unfortunately, the authors have failed to followed the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Not even the first point on the PRISMA checklist has been ticked: “Identify the report as a systematic review”. Consequently, “writer’s block” must still be considered an open empirical issue ☝️
