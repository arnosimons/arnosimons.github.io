Instrument constituencies shed light on the [‘supply side’](/instrument-constituencies-supply-side) of policy-making and thereby fill a gap in our understanding of national and transnational policy dynamics. Policy instruments are not only ‘active’ because they contain scripts for reordering society but also because they gather a constituency comprised of practices and actors oriented towards developing, maintaining and expanding a specific instrumental model of governing. Instrument constituencies account for a hitherto neglected form of agency and explain the often-observed paradox that policy solutions sometimes chase policy problems, although the former are meant to emerge as answers to the later. In this article in *Policy and Society*, Jan-Peter Voß and I give an outline of the concept as we and others have developed it, formulate propositions, and discuss linkages with established research traditions in policy studies.
