New markets are key in debates concerning environmental regimes. Critics and proponents share a discourse that characterizes environmental markets in terms of scale; many discuss how to scale environmental markets ‘the right way’. In this article for Environmental Politics, Aleksandra Lis, Ingmar Lippert, and I build on previous work in human geography, actor–network theory, and governmentality studies to unpack the dual but always interwoven politics of scale-making in doing environmental policies, which consists of material-semiotic practices of producing and using scales as ontologically real ordering devices. Drawing from the results of our empirical studies on carbon and biodiversity markets, we analyze material-semiotic scale-making practices in different ways of enacting environmental markets. By revealing the dual politics of scale production and use in environmental markets, our analysis contributes to the study of developing and implementing environmental governance.
