themes: 
    - Policy Instrument Constituencies

In this article for a themed issue in *Environmental Conservation* on 'Tradable Rights in Conservation', Carsten Mann and I trace the emergence, development, and spread of conservation trading from its early beginning in US mitigation practice towards its internationalization as an accepted policy solution for biodiversity protection. A special focus is on the formation and activities of an increasingly transnational policy instrument constituency, i.e. an actor group that forms around a policy instrument, in support of it. 

The analysis shows that the development of conservation trading was predominantly guided by a constituency of dominant, business-oriented actors who started first in the national context of the US and then tied connections to international networks with a similar market-driven orientation for environmental protection. By strategically combining agenda-driven research with the mobilization of political support, this constituency helped to establish conservation trading as a widely acknowledged policy solution applicable to various ecological and socio-political contexts. Yet, this was achieved in part at the cost of neglecting critical issues, such as the recognition of policy alternatives or socio-ecological or cultural context particularities. 

Whereas the development of conservation trading is sometimes portrayed as a rational process of neutral policy learning, this process, through its constituency, has developed a life and political momentum of its own, which one should be aware of when engaging with the design and implementation of better conservation policies. As an outlook, we suggest a forward-looking social policy assessment approach, which opens up policy design discourses for debate and reflexive engagement. Acknowledging possible shortcomings with a broad range of concerned societal actors can help to assure policy transparency, add specificity, and increase the sound ecological and societal embedding of conservation trading.
