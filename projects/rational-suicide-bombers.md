From the perspective of rational choice theory, acts of suicide terrorism appear irrational at first. How can "homo oeconomicus" rationally decide to kill himself? In my Bachelor thesis, which was published as a [contribution](https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/zur-rationalitaet-von-selbstmordattentaetern-kritische-ueberlegu/2607794) to *Jahrbuch für Handlungs- und Entscheidungstheorie*, Joscha Legewie and I critically engaged with rational choice theory (RCT) and its application to suicide terrorism. We developed a three-step sequential group-dynamical process model to explain how people can become suicide bombers by *first* entering a terrorist organization, *second* declaring their readiness to go on a suicide mission, and *three* performing the mission. We discussed the applicability of this model in several real-world cases and concluded that RCT in itself cannot explain suicide terrorism, but that it might be fruitfully combined with social constructivist approaches.
