The CRISPR gene editing technology is praised as a major scientific breakthrough and it is linked to high-stakes patent battles. Underlying this battle and common for a discovery and invention of this magnitude, the question of who are the “Heroes of CRISPR” became fiercely debated in the biomedical field and beyond. Here we show that the scientific priority and contributions of individual CRISPR researchers have also been disputed on Wikipedia, a major source of factual knowledge on the Web, including knowledge about science history. 

Using new analysis tools for combining distant and close readings, we find priority disputes in three areas of concern: (1) the discovery of CRISPR, (2) the discovery of CRISPR-associated systems, and (3) the invention of CRISPR-based gene editing—as well as cases of academic self-promotion. To visualize Wikipedia’s collaborative account of priority, we present a “Hero plot” positioning key CRISPR researchers along four dimensions—“prominence”, “controversiality”, “endurance”, and “age”—for which we propose indicators.

We conclude that Wikipedia works as a filter for scientific relevance and discuss academic self-promotion on Wikipedia. Our paper is the first to reflect Wikipedia’s role in scientific priority disputes, and we argue that this role deserves further scholarly and practical attention.
