My doctoral dissertation traces the discursive construction of emissions trading as a policy instrument ‘that works’.

I analyzed a set of 180 documents from the science-policy nexus (scientific articles and books, think tank publications, policy reports, green papers, etc.), which I assembled using a snowballing approach based on citation counts. My analysis builds on the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD) and utilizes what I call a relational discourse analysis (RDA), an interpretative analytics informed by bibliometric tools. This approach allowed me to map the emissions trading discourse as an unfolding network of heterogeneous documents connected through citations and co-occurring discursive resources. I ‘zoomed’ in and out of this network to analyze simultaneously the individual documentary utterances, their relations to other documents, and the network as a whole.

A key finding is the crucial role of intertextuality. The discursive construction of emissions trading as a ‘working’ policy instrument is an emergent network effect, which cannot be reduced to any single documentary utterance. It was the interplay of different documentary utterances and genres over time–--the way in which different documents ‘speak’ to each other in the network-–-that stabilized certain authoritative knowledge claims about emissions trading.

The thesis concludes that documentary networks at the science-policy nexus are infrastructures for the production and stabilization of authoritative governance knowledge. This is because documents, especially in networked form, produce a strong sense of extra-local authority and thereby allow for ‘governing at a distance’, a prerequisite for policymaking through generic instruments.
