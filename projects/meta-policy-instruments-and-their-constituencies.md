Puzzled by the question why evidence-based policy (EBP) thrives despite good evidence against it, Alexander Schniedermann and I reconstructed the development and spread of EBP in inter- and transnational contexts in an article in *Policy & Politics*. We found that this process is characterised by some of the same dynamics (including ‘structural promises’ and ‘problem chasing’) that have also been observed [in many policy instruments](/the-concept-of-instrument-constituencies). We therefore propose a double reframing: EBP is (1) a ‘meta-instrument’ aiming to establish a particular role for research in policymaking (our ideational reframing) and (2) co-evolving with an ‘instrument constituency’ motivated not only by normative goals but also by the prospect of securing an occupational niche for itself (our social reframing). Taken together, these reframings reveal the neglected politics behind EBP and prompt us to treat EBP as a political device rather than as an analytical framework to explain how policymaking actually relates to research.
