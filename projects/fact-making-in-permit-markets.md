How does a government like the EU know how to govern through a ‘cap and trade’ system? In this chapter in the edited volumne *Knowing Governance* I focus on how the ‘cap and trade’ blueprint was materially inscribed and stabilized in cross-referencing documents from different domains. Mobilizing insights about the social roles of documents from science and technology studies, media studies, and organizational sociology, I explore the notion of document networks at the science–policy nexus as infrastructures of the production of authoritative governance knowledge. My analysis sheds light on both the semantic and the material material dimensions of governance knowledge.
